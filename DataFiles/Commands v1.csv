beyondchaos,"Originally developed by Abyssonym, then maintained by SubtractionSoup, now maintained by DarkSlash88, Beyond Chaos is a randomizer, a program that remixes game content randomly, for FF6. Every time you run Beyond Chaos, it will generate a completely unique, brand-new mod of FF6 for you to challenge and explore. Nearly everything is randomized, including treasure, enemies, colors, graphics, character abilities, music, sprites, and more."
